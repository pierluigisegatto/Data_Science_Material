# Segmenting-and-Clustering-Neighbourhoods-in-Toronto
The repository is a part of the IBM Data Science Capstone project. The project includes the segmentation and clustering of Neighbourhoods in Toronto using K Means Machine Learning Clustering algorithm. 

Features are extracted using the Foursquare RestfulAPI.

Clusters are based on similarity among neighborhoods points of interests.

The first map contains the visualization of the various neighbourhoods in Canada whose borough has the word Toronto.

    "Milan is the second-most populous city in Italy after Rome. \n",
    "The city proper has a population of about 1.4 million while its metropolitan city has 3.26 million inhabitants ([ISTAT](http://demo.istat.it/bilmens2019gen/index.html)). Its continuously built-up urban area, that stretches well beyond the boundaries of the administrative metropolitan city, is the fourth largest in the EU with 5.27 million inhabitants. The population within the wider Milan metropolitan area, also known as Greater Milan, is estimated at 8.2 million, making it by far the largest metropolitan area in Italy and the 3rd largest in the EU ([source](http://www.old.unimib.it/open/news/Le-aree-metropolitane-in-Italia-occupano-il-9-per-cento-del-territorio/193547881368277998)). <br />\n",
    "Milan is considered a leading global city, with strengths in the field of the art, commerce, design, education, entertainment, fashion, finance, healthcare, media, services, research and tourism. The city has been recognized as one of the world's four fashion capitals thanks to several international events and fairs, including Milan Fashion Week and the Milan Furniture Fair, which are currently among the world's biggest in terms of revenue, visitors and growth. It hosts numerous cultural institutions, academies and universities. <br />\n",
    "Whereas Rome is Italy's political capital, Milan is the country's industrial and financial heart. In 2019 GDP per-capita of Milan is estimated at €49.000, steadily increasing, and significantly higher that the Italian average of €26.000 ([source](https://www.assolombarda.it/media/comunicati-stampa/rassegna-stampa-osservatorio-milano-2019-7-novembre-2019)). <br />\n",
    "Milan is the destination of 11 million visitors in 2019 (as reported in the city website ([source](https://www.comune.milano.it/-/turismo.-nel-2019-sfiorati-11-milioni-di-visitatori)), attracted by its museums and art galleries, that include some of the most important collections in the world, like the major works by Leonardo da Vinci. The city is served by many luxury hotels and dreamy restaurants. <br />\n",
    "Last but not least, Milan will host the 2026 Winter Olympics together with Cortina d'Ampezzo. <br />"

The [Milan borough dataset](#Borough) allowed to determine the value of the house, on the basis of the borough position and the state of the property. Neighborhoods locations have been fundamental to understand the correlation between the neighborhood positions (in terms of distance from the Milan city center) and the value of the houses. These positions, together with venues data, have been essential to determinate the clusters and identify the most common venues for each of them."
